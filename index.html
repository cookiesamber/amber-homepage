<p>On this net we talk about cereal and vans and other random stuff so come to this net if you're bored. Email me @littlesunnydawn if you have any questions.</p>
<img src="cereal.jpg"><p>my favorite type of cereal is captain crunch but my family barely buys it because it's too sweet and is very unhealthy.</p>
<p>also I really don't like eating my cereal with milk becuase I don't like milk very much because of the texture and the taste. Ugh I don't like milk at all!</p>

<p>Vans are a good everyday shoe because what's amazing about vans is that even after they get dirty they still look good. My favorite versions of the vans are the sk8 and low top sk8 I like the colors white and black or light purple. </p>

 <p>I also have a big obsession with cacti so let's talk about that.My favorite type of cati are the ruby ball I like them in yellow or the redish-pink color they look really cool. I saw them at this plant market in boston. I don't have one yet but I'm getting one this summer to put in my room so that's good. In this article I read it said their really easy to care for.</p>

<p>self-love ch.1</p>
<p>For the first chapter of the self-love series i'm doing on my net I wanted to talk about being confident in the clothes you decide to wear. 
I happen to really like the 90's but hipster look and some of the clothes I wear you would'nt see any one else wear such as a grandma style wind breaker or high waisted mom jeans or 90's styled top you probably won't see anyone wearing those clothing items today. 
So when I see something I like I usually say oh would I really wear this or no one else is wearing this but I usually end up buying it anyway with the mind set that I'm the one that's wearing the clothing item this is my style and I really like how it looks and this style is apart of my personality. 
Mainly the people that question my style are my siblings and their usually just saying it to make fun of me and I unfortunatly have to wear a uniform to school so no one at my school really questions my style because they only see it through a instagram picture.  Most of my freinds also share the love of 90's style with me so there's no rude remarks from them. Anyway if you do happen to have freinds or others who question your style just brush their remarks off and keep wearing what your wearing because it's a part of your style and your personality. :) 


<p>self love ch.2</p>
<p>In this chapter we talk the very improtant topic of body confidence. This topic can make people say yea! or make some people groan bcause they've heard about it or read about 
so may times but it's an important topic. I guess we should talk about the modelling industry and how that industry makes absolutely no sense to me because their excluding so many people
and culture and faces and bodies and only picking skinny, clear skinned, and fair skinned people and even with those people they still do a bunch of photo editing. So what about those medium sized or larg sized or extra large sized 
wearers. Or those people with zits and other flaws that make them beautiful any way what about them? why are'nt they popping up in covergirl or teen vogue. They model industry is slowly realizing there are plus size people too and having them model on websites and on bill boards and ads so I will happily say the model industry is progressing. But in the mean while do me a favor and remeber
the color of your skin or what size pants you wear does not define your value or worth or the beauty standards of society because were all good and worth it. so yep.</p>



<p>books I rly want to read</p>
<p>-note to self by connor franta I really want to read this book because it seems really inspirational and it has a lot of really important topics and topics im passionate 
about. It talks about connor's child hood and how he has grown a lot and a bunch of other great treasures in it I keep reading the sample on the Barnes and Noble site but yea
I really want to read note to self.</p> 
<img src="note.jpg">
<p>-the other book I really want to read is Milk and Honey by rupi kaur. I want to read this book because it seems very powerful and it feels like rupi's thoughts were just 
poured onto the page and she did'nt stop writting until it was all out. Again I also keep reading the book sample on the Barnes and Noble site and it sounds
really really good and I love the book cover I will probably end up trying to draw the cover of the book sometime.yep those are the books I really want to read right now. bye.</p>
