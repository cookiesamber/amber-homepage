<img src="cereal.jpg"><p>my favorite type of cereal is captain crunch but my family barely buys it because it's too sweet and is very unhealthy.</p>
<p>also I really don't like eating my cereal with milk becuase I don't like milk very much because of the texture and the taste. Ugh I don't like milk at all!</p>

<p>Vans are a good everyday shoe because what's amazing about vans is that even after they get dirty they still look good. My favorite versions of the vans are the sk8 and low top sk8 I like the colors white and black or light purple. </p>

<p>I also have a big obsession with cacti so let's talk about that.My favorite type of cati are the ruby ball I like them in yellow or the redish-pink color they look really cool. I saw them at this plant market in boston. I don't have one yet but I'm getting one this summer to put in my room so that's good. In this article I read it said their really easy to care for.</p>

I want to get one in air blue or a lilac color I saw a couple of them at urban Outfitters and on this website called eastdane. I hope I get one soon because they are amazing.</p>
